This will wall you through how to setup the systems that are required by the setup generator and how to generate the setup file for Dtronix Upload Client.


= Details =

  # Download the NSIS program. [http://dtronix-upload.googlecode.com/files/nsis-2.46-setup.exe]
  # Install the NSIS program in the *default location*.  This is important because the bat file that will be used later searches for the makensis.exe file in its default location.
  # Open up Visual Studio 2010 and switch the mode to _Release_
  # Right click on the dtxUpload project and build the client.  This will automatically build the project and run the installer generator.
To find the setup file, browse to the bin/release/Installer folder and look for the setup.exe.

If you just want to manually build the setup.exe, you can browse to your bin/release/Installer folder, and run the build.bat.  Just make sure that the project is already built so as to not generate an outdated setup file.
